                Palembang, kota (city) and capital of South Sumatra (Sumatera Selatan) propinsi (or provinsi; province), Indonesia. 
                It lies on both banks of the Musi River, there spanned by the Ampera Bridge, one of Indonesia’s longest bridges. 
                Palembang is the second largest city on the island of Sumatra (after Medan). Its population is predominantly Malay, with a notable Chinese minority.

                Palembang served as the capital of the Buddhist Srivijaya empire from the 7th to the late 12th century, when the empire’s centre shifted to the city of Jambi to the northwest. 
                In the 13th century Palembang came under the domination of the Hindu Majapahit empire, which was based on the neighbouring island of Java. 
                When Palembang rejected Javanese authority in the late 14th century, the empire responded by destroying the city.
                <br><br>
                Although the ravaged Palembang remained a nominal vassal of Majapahit, the city was governed by Chinese merchants until Majapahit disintegrated about the turn of the 16th century. 
                Meanwhile, Palembang had converted to Islam, and in the mid-17th century the city became the seat of a sultanate.
